Now we can cross check and see that we have created a runs dub directory in picorv32a subdirectory, by typing this path in command prompt (in new tab) Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane->designs->picorv32a and then list the files/directories by ls -ltr

when we change directory to runs and list we find one sub-directory 30-01_15-53 and by again moving to this sub-directory by typing cd 30-01_15-53 and then list the content by  ls -ltr command, we get to see the subb-directories created during our working (in my case between Jan 28-31, 2025), including tmp.  Again when we move into this sub-directory, and list the contents, we get to see the files created on Jan 30 and 31, 2025 (during my working on virtual machine).
